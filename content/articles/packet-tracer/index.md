### Getting started with Packet tracer

Packet tracer is a network simulation tool. This means a user can be able to create imaginary network topologies and imitate the functionality of a live network with them. The user can create routers and switches on the percent traced user interface and then go ahead to configure and make them function like they were real-life physical devices.

### Prerequisites
A reader will be able to understand this article clearly if they have the following prior  knowledge:
- An understanding of computer networking
- A beginner's  understanding of network development

### Introduction
Packet tracer was developed by Cisco for educational purposes especially for their CCNA courses and its functionalities have grown with time due to the impressive results it has shown with network simulation. Hence the most commonly used simulator is the Cisco Packet Tracer.

Packet tracer can be installed and run in Windows, Linux, and Macintosh operating systems.


### Why do we need packet tracer

- Packet tracers through its network simulation capabilities are used by students to learn network creation and configuration. This is advisable considering the prices of the devices if the learners used real devices to learn.

- Packet tracer allows for networked collaboration due to its ability to support systems with multiple users

- Packet tracer is used in network simulation. Before an actual network is developed, a prototype can be made using a packet tracer just to predict the network performance before actual development.

### How to install  Cisco packet tracer for windows operating system
After successfully downloading the packet tracer from the internet, the following steps are executed with the downloaded installation life in readiness for use.

### Step 1

Open the installation file that you have just downloaded and a pop-up window will appear which is the welcome window as shown:

![welcome](/engineering-education/packet-tracer/welcome.png)

On this window, you just need to click next to continue with the installation process.
### Step 2
Clicking next on the first window opens up the second configuration window where you just need to accept the Cisco software license agreement by checking the check-box and click next to proceed as shown below:

### Step 3
Accepting the agreement in step 2 opens up the third configuration window where you are required to specify the folder where you want your packet tracer to be installed. Most of the time it is just advisable to leave the already specified installation location though one can always change it. Once satisfied with the installation location, click Next.

### Step 4

Having specified your installation location, the fourth configuration window requires you to specify the start menu detail. ie the program shortcut location. A user is usually advised to leave this unchanged though altering to specify a folder of your liking is allowed.

### Step 5

This step allows you to create a Desktop icon for your home screen or even a quick launch icon for a quick start-up of the application by just checking the checkboxes on that configuration window as shown below:

### Step 6
This is the last step of this installation, displayed in the configuration window are the details of the installation. Here you are not required to make any changes but just click install to begin installing Packet tracer in your device.

The installation process should take a few seconds after which a window will pop up prompting you to finish the installation process. Click Finish to exit the setup window.

### How does packet tracer work?

Having completed the installation process, you are required to sign in to the account because Cisco Packet tracer is not a free software. At the bottom right of the sign-in window is a "Guest login", Click that to start using Packet tracer immediately.

The software has a user-friendly interface where a user can add and remove The network devices by simply dragging and dropping. The devices can then be joined to one another using physical item "cable".
Bellow is the user interface where the networks are created.

Below is an example of a network where three personal computers are connected to a switch. 
- To add the three personal computers, click a personal computer on the bottom left of the user interface, drag it to your desired location and drop it.
Do that for the three devices that you want to include in the network.

- To add a switch, pick a switch amongst the devices in the bottom left and drop it in your desired location.
- To connect the Personal computers to the switch, choose a connection cable of your choice amongst the cables under your screen.
The outcome is shown below:

Packet trace also allows you to delete devices and connections from your network using the "x" symbol on the right side of the work area.

### Conclusion

Packet tracer is an important tool in the education sector especially with the network simulation capability hence saving resources that would otherwise be used in training learners with actual devices and cables. This is a breakthrough not only for the economy but also for the learners who rely on packet tracers for practical know-how.

Blissful reading!
